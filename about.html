                <h4>The Swiss Yodel Choir Matterhorn, Melbourne</h4>
            </div>

            <p>The Swiss Yodel Matterhorn Choir was founded in 1969 by a few enthusiastic Swiss emigrants in Melbourne who were missing their folkloristic
                traditions from Switzerland. From early on it has been linked to the ‘Swiss Yodeller Association’, keeping to official singing traditions.
                <br><br>
                The Choir aims to keep the joy of Swiss yodelling and other folkloristic traditions alive among the Swiss expatriates, and to bring these
                enjoyments closer to Australians. Over the years it has organised and taken part in many events for the Swiss community in Victoria and
                performed at many special occasions to broader audiences. Highlights in the Choir’s performance history were the participation in the Swiss
                Yodelling Festivals in Fribourg in, 2002 as the official “guest of honour from abroad” and again in Interlaken in 2011. In 2007 the Choir
                produced a CD with a sample of its yodelling songs and a few instrumental pieces.
                <br><br>
                The Matterhorn Choir was revitalised in 2016 when five ladies joined the Choir. Under the leadership of Choir Master Chris Hostettler we are
                continuing to hone our singing and yodelling skills and are now establishing a repertoire of well-practiced songs. The members of the Choir
                enjoy not only singing together but also the social interaction at our gatherings. With our singing we hope to bring pleasure to others for many
                years to come!
